This branch is a fork of the [NativeScript getting started guide](http://docs.nativescript.org/getting-started)'s 'end' branch. Use it to learn how to integrate NativeScript with Firebase.

Firebase is a backend service that pairs well with NativeScript on the client side for mobile apps.

1. Create an account and an app project in [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) and replace the URL of the Firebase app in this branch's config file. 

2. Fork this repo to your local computer and install the Firebase plugin by navigating to the root of the app and typing `npm install` in the command line.

3. You can start managing groceries as soon as you can run your app on device or on a local simulator. Please refer to the [Firebase plugin documentation](http://plugins.telerik.com/nativescript/plugin/firebase) to learn more, and how you can enhance the app by leveraging more functions of this plugin.
